9/7:
did everything (adding notes from google doc later)
- following the written tutorial (starting at 10:00)
- working on the player, having a hard time understanding how scenes work
- done with player (10:57)
- starting on enemy (11:15)
- much easier now that I've done the player
- took me 10 minutes to figure out how to add a new scene
- done with enemy (12:26)
need a brain break
- starting main (2:00)
- super easy because the tutorial is just giving me the code to paste in
- very intently reading the tutorial so I can understand what's going on
- the coding part is easy, the more difficult thing to understand is the sprites and stuff, but I think that I just don't like how easy it is and how Godot has integrated a lot of stuff for me
- done with main (2:39)
- starting HUD (2:45)
- super easy, I'm really understanding this now!
- done! (3:18)

9/8:
adding lives mod (starting at 11:15)
- couldnt figure out how to update the message for the "lives" thing
- realized it was due to mislabeling (I was calling "LivesLabel" but it was actually called "Lives")
- finished the lives mod at 12:20

9/9: 
adding audio mod (starting at 1:00)
- fairly simple from following youtube tutorial (credit 2)
- downloaded boom sound (credit 3)
- finished mod at 1:10
customizing players (starting at 4:30)
- got files from online (credit 4)
- modified them so they would work with animations
- changed the message to say "ricks" instead of "creeps"
done! (7:00 with breaks in between)
